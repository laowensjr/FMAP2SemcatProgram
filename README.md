My Notes on How to Use GITHUB
To Add to gitHUB  files after you have transferred them into the appropriate directory
1) cd c:\wamp\www\fmap2semcat\gitHub_FMAP2SEMCAT, then "git add ." to add all untracked files, followed by "git commit -m "MY MSG" " , and finally do a "git push -u origin master" This will upload the files. Now do a "git log" to see the commits that were made and the messages attched to each commit(My MSG). Use vim to read file, use it like "vim filename.php" then hit esc key then type ":x" to exit and save or INSERT key once you vim the filename to write in it
