fmap2Semcat
===========

A web application that allows  you to create a quote for each FMAP  record you upload through the click of a series of buttons that will auto-fill the required information from each FMAP record you upload into the appropriate forms within Semcat website

cURL function was used

Essentially this program allows you to upload your FMAP excel file in. The program would take the information from the file and use it to fill out the forms on another website called Semcat, which is now Applied Rater ( the industry's fastest growing comparative rater for homeowner insurance quoting) 
Once the forms have been filled out the program would receive a response back from the website and show that response to the user.


You would download a FMAP Excel file from https://www.fmap.org/index.cfm that contains unstructured customer data for a homeowners insurance referral.
